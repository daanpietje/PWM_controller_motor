PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Complete_design_car_i/PWM_generator_0/U0/PWM_Over_i/Comparator_0/U0/pwm_temp_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Complete_design_car_i/PWM_generator_0/U0/PWM_Over_i/Comparator_0/U0/pwm_temp_reg/L3_2/O, cell Complete_design_car_i/PWM_generator_0/U0/PWM_Over_i/Comparator_0/U0/pwm_temp_reg/L3_2 (in Complete_design_car_i/PWM_generator_0/U0/PWM_Over_i/Comparator_0/U0/pwm_temp_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Complete_design_car_i/PWM_generator_0/U0/PWM_Over_i/DataChecker_0/U0/lastsenddata_reg[7]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Complete_design_car_i/PWM_generator_0/U0/PWM_Over_i/DataChecker_0/U0/lastsenddata_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell Complete_design_car_i/PWM_generator_0/U0/PWM_Over_i/DataChecker_0/U0/lastsenddata_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Complete_design_car_i/PWM_generator_0/U0/PWM_Over_i/DataChecker_0/U0/senddata_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Complete_design_car_i/PWM_generator_0/U0/PWM_Over_i/DataChecker_0/U0/senddata_reg_i_1/O, cell Complete_design_car_i/PWM_generator_0/U0/PWM_Over_i/DataChecker_0/U0/senddata_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check
